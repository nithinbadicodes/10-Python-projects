        "* Whenever a player guesses, she gives a clue: “Too high” or “Too low”. Only those with intuition can guess correctly. Can you code the game and help others test their future-seeing powers?\n",
        "* Solution: Use the random module to generate a random number. Use a loop to prompt the user for guesses and provide feedback.\n",
        "* Task: The computer randomly selects a number, and the user tries to guess it. Provide feedback such as “Too high” or “Too low”. Continue until the correct number is guessed. Key Concepts: Loops, conditionals, user input, random module."
